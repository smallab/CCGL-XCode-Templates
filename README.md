**CocoaCinderGL eases the use of Cinder from within a typical XCode/Cocoa project.** Thus allowing C++/Obj-C creative coders to build MacOS apps bearing several "Cinder sketches" as well as Cocoa sliders, buttons...

These XCode templates provide starting points for applications that use Cinder from within a typical Cocoa environment. The basic template features a MayaCam, a colored cube and a Cocoa slider to control the size of the cube.

To install the templates, **place their *.xctemplate folders** inside of **/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/Mac/Application**, besides "Cocoa Application Base.xctemplate", "Cocoa Application.xctemplate", etc.
